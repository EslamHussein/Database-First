- No one likes to open an app and wait forever for data to be displayed or to find an empty screen in front of them. A lot of the applications users like to use such as Instagram, tumblr, news apps, etc. show something to the user till the new data arrives. This gives the user something to do/read till the new data comes from the server. In other words applications that respect the offline/database approach first.
